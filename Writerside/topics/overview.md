# Important Things to Remember

This is an experiment for me to try Writerside and also note down some important things to remember.

## Learning Motivation as shown from playing games

I found that both gaming and learning have a lot in common. Both require a lot of patience and practice. And both require a lot of trial and error.
Along with that I need to tried to learn and understand the game mechanics and the game world the game's rules. And also the game's lore and story.
I am very happy to dwell into the game wiki and forum just to learn more about the game. It is learning in a fun way what else can it be.
Also, during free time , I tried to think how I can apply these knowledge above to my game. And happy to wait to try my new strategy

### So What to learn from this

1. **Patience and Practice** - Both require a lot of patience and practice. And both require a lot of trial and error.
2. **Understand the rules** - Learn and understand the game mechanics and the game world the game's rules. Same with learning I need to learn the basic concept of the topic.
3. **Understand the story** - Learn and understand the game's lore and story. The same thing with the concept of the topic of learning.
4. **Learn from others** - Dwell into the game wiki and forum just to learn more about the game. Same with dwell in the documentation and forum to learn more about the topic.
5. **Apply the knowledge** - Think how I can apply these knowledge above to my game. And happy to wait to try my new strategy. Same with the concept of learning. I will try think how I can apply this and then really apply the knowledge of my learning.
6. **Fun** - It is learning in a fun way what else can it be. So in the end, learning should be fun and enjoyable just like games.


## Mental 

Also, I found it is hard to learn when I am not in the right mental state and if I am too fatigue to learn. So I need to take care of my mental health and also my physical health.
As a result I need come with ways to recover quickly and also to keep my mental health in check.

### Some ways to recover quickly

1. **Coffee and Tea** - I found that coffee and tea can help me to up for the task but it like making a debt of energy that I need to pay back later. So I need to use it wisely plus it can cause me not able to sleep at night.
2. **Sleep** - I found that sleep is very important to recover my mental health and also my physical health. So I need to make sure I have enough sleep. 7 Hours are too little for me. I need at least 8 hours of sleep (plus some at noon). but best if 9 hours of sleep.
3. **mediation** - I found that meditation can help me to relax and also to recover my mental health. So I need to meditate more often especially when I am stress. and I found meditation with music is the best
4. **Exercise** - About 5 min of sprinting should be enough to recover my mental health and also my physical health. I need to do it more often.
5. **Break** - Best to take some but currently I did not take any break. I should take big break like at noon or at night before study to gain more energy.
6. **Music** - I found that music can help me to relax and also to recover my mental health. So I need to listen to music more often especially when I felt bored
7. **Reading** - I found that reading can help me to relax but can conflict with my meditation so it could be a replacement for studying.
8. **Alcohol** - I found that quickest to relax is alcohol but it should not be too much so about 1 can of beer or less is enough. But if too little it will not work. So I need to use it wisely. and preferly if I think I will relax for at least 1 hour.
9. **Food** - 1 Meal a day is too spartan. 3 meal is ideal but 1 large meal and 2 small meal is enough
